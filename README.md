Code for reproducing Estimating the Spectral Moments of the Kernel Integral Operator from Finite Sample Matrices.

`momest` function in `estimator.py` implements our dynamic programming algorithm for computing the spectral moments from a measurement matrix (or two measurement matrices if two trials are available).
