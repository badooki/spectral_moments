Code for reproducing "Estimating the Spectral Moments of the Kernel Integral Operator from Finite Sample Matrices": [Link to the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17998).


`momest` function in `estimator.py` implements our dynamic programming algorithm for computing the spectral moments from a measurement matrix (or two measurement matrices if two trials are available).
